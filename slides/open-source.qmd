## Open Source vs. Free Software

-   *Free software* refers to software that doesn't cost you anything to use
-   *Open source software* refers to software whose source code has been shared publicly so that others can re-use and/or remix it

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why might we choose to make software open source?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Licensing

-   Licenses identify the conditions under which other individuals may re-use or remix source code
-   Without specifying a license, code on Github.com is copyrighted. 
-   Copyleft: an alternative to copyright laws that indicates that code *must* remain free and open
-   There are many existing licenses, and I've provided some links to help you choose between them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Securing Files

-   Sharing source code could reveal sensitive information 
-   Adding a `.gitignore` file to repos allows you to specify files that should not be tracked via version control. 
-   When creating repos at github.com, `.gitignore` templates are provided specific to different coding languages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Documentation

-   README files are files that outline what others need to know about a project.
-   Good README files often include:
  -   A project description
  -   Project contributors
  -   A roadmap/overview of the repo's organization
  -   An explanation of how others can install/configure the code
  -   An overview of how to contribute to the project
  -   Information on how to ask questions or request changes to the code
  


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Issues

- Support project planning by allowing you to create a wishlist of project changes
- Allow your team and others to report bugs, request features, or ask questions
- github.com enables you to assign collaborators to issues so that you can keep track of who is responsible for what
