## Introduction

In this workshop, we will practice a git workflow and learn best practices for publishing code on GitHub.com


## Open Source Best Practices

- [Slides](slides/open-source.html)
- [Example Open Source Project](https://github.com/BetaNYC/nyc-boundaries)
- Help with [choosing a license](https://choosealicense.com/)
- [README templates](https://www.readme-templates.com/) available for open source projects 
- Other useful [workshop materials](https://open-source-for-researchers.github.io/open-source-workshop/01-what-is-open-source)

## git/GitHub Workflow Demonstrations

- [Slides](slides/git-demonstration.html)

- git command line [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)


## Setting Up GitHub Desktop

Follow instructions at [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop) to set-up GitHub Desktop. Specifically, you will need to:

1. Install GitHub Desktop
2. Create a GitHub account and configure it with GitHub Desktop
3. Configure git (especially if you have a Windows laptop)

## Setting Up Your First GitHub Repo

### Create a Repo in GitHub

  - Add a Description
  - Set the repository to be Public
  - Add a `README.md` file
  - Add a `.gitignore` file
  - Select an open source license

### Add collaborators

  - Navigate to `Settings > Collaborators and Teams`
  - Click `Add People`
  - Enter a collaborators' username and grant them "Write" permissions
  - All team members accept invitation
  
### Clone to your local machine

If you are using GitHub Desktop, you can clone the repository by clicking `File > Clone Repository`. Once the repository is cloned to your computer, you can navigate to that folder and open `README.md` in your preferred text editor. 

### Update the `README.md`

  - Describe the purpose of your repository in `README.md`
  - List all of the project collaborators
  - Save the file. 
  - Stage and commit changes in GitHub Desktop. 
    - Be sure to leave a descriptive commit message!

### Push Changes back to github.com
